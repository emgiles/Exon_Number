# Exon_Number

#### Script for generating a plot of number of exons per transcript for multiple genome comparisons
This script was generated for recovering exons from genomes of three different species of limpets. Parts of this script were retrieved from various parts of the internet. Reminder: Whatâ€™s the distinction between genes and transcripts? A gene is generally defined as a region in the genome which is transcribed. However, the specific combination of exons is referred to as a transcript. The different transcripts that a gene produces can be referred to as isoforms of the gene. To give an example, suppose we have a gene with exons E1, E2, E3, E4. And there are two transcripts, or isoforms, of this gene: one which includes E3, and one which excludes E3.
